Do the callback rates change depending on the race and gender of the person

What percentage of each of the four categories (wm, ww, bm, bw) get callbacks in chicago and boston

The units would be which of the categories the individual is a part of (wm, ww, bm, bw) and the outcome would be whether or not they got a callback
